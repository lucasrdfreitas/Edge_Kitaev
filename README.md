# Edge_Kitaev
The collection of Mathematica codes that I used in my master project. 

The initial idea for the project was to analise the Kitaev honeycomb model in a open geometry 
(e.g. retangular) and make a effective theory for the edges.

* Manipulate.nb : Code for view the energy dispersion and allow to vary the parameters.
* Figures.nb  : Contains the graphics that I made in mathematica; it is the same code as in the previous code, but the graphics             are made in higher resolution.
